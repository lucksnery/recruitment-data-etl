Title: Generate a CSV File with Simulated Recruitment Data for ETL Processing

Description:

I need a CSV file that simulates candidate data collected from a recruitment form for a Data Engineer position. This file will be used as input for an ETL pipeline, so the data must intentionally contain inconsistencies, lack of standardization, and common real-world data quality issues, as if it were filled out by different people.

The CSV file must contain 40 rows, each representing a different candidate. All candidates must be 24 years old or older and must be located in Brazil. Prefer Brazilian state capitals with different states, but repetitions are allowed.

The dataset should include the following columns:

CPF
Random Brazilian CPF numbers. They do not need to be valid, only realistic in format. Use different formats, with and without dots and hyphens.

Name
Random first name and last name. Allow mixed capitalization and minor inconsistencies.

Gender
Values should be Male or Female.

Email
Random email addresses, preferably using firstname.lastname@gmail.com
or firstname.lastname@hotmail.com
. Allow small inconsistencies such as uppercase letters or missing dots.

LinkedIn
Random LinkedIn profile URLs using the format https://www.linkedin.com/in/firstname.lastname
. Variations such as hyphens, uppercase letters, or missing dots are allowed.

DateOfBirth
Random dates. All candidates must be older than 24 years.

Location
Brazilian cities, preferably state capitals. Use different formats such as “São Paulo - SP”, “Rio de Janeiro/RJ”, or “Belo Horizonte MG”.

YearsOfExperience
Numeric values representing professional experience. Allow inconsistencies such as integers, decimals, or text values like “five years”.

CurrentRole
Random job titles related to the technology field, such as Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Software Engineer, BI Analyst, or Backend Developer.

SalaryExpectation
Values between 6,000 and 12,000 BRL. Use intentionally inconsistent formats, for example:
8000
8.500
R$ 9000 CLT
10000 PJ
12k
7000 - PJ
